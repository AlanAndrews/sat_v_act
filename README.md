### Overview

This week in class we went over some basic statistics, learned some Python programming concepts, and also learned how to navigate files, packages, and libraries using the command line. Great start! At this point you should be chomping at the bit to _do some Data Science_. If so, good - because it's time for Project 1!

For our first project, we're going to take a look at SAT and ACT scores around the United States. We'll be exploring this data to see what we can learn using the descriptive statistics skills covered this week. Your client, the College Board, is expecting some pretty graphs to add to their presentations this year, so don't let them down!

**Goal**: A Jupyter notebook that describes your data with visualizations & statistical analysis.

**Goal**: A five to seven minute presentation targeted to your hypothetical client that highlights your findings.

### Requirements

Your work must _at a minimum_:

- Describe your data
- Perform methods of exploratory data analysis, including:
  - Use Matplotlib to create visualizations
  - Use NumPy to apply basic summary statistics: mean, median, mode
- Determine if the dataset appears to follow a normal distribution
- Display your cleaned Jupyter notebook on a personal static website.

#### ***Bonus:***
 - Recreate all of your MatPlotLib graphs in Seaborn!
 - Use Tableau (public) to create visualizations!
 - Create a blog post of at least 500 words (and 1-2 graphics!) describing your data, analysis, and approach. Link to it in your Jupyter notebook.
 - Using existing features, engineer a new feature

While there are very specific asks in the starter code, these are only requirements, not restrictions. Feel free to do more EDA, feature engineering, visualization, etc. than what is requested.

### Necessary Deliverables / Submission

- Materials must be submitted in a clearly commented Jupyter notebook.
- Notebook must be submitted via pushing to the remote repo.
- Presentation must be submitted via slack (for a powerpoint file) or shared via a google form.
- Materials must be submitted by 9:00 AM on Friday, October 6th.

### Starter code

For this project we will be using a Jupyter notebook. This notebook will use matplotlib
for plotting and visualizing our data. This type of visualization is handy for prototyping
and quick data analysis. We will discuss more advanced data visualizations for disseminating your work.

Open the [starter code instructions](./code/) in a Jupyter notebook.

### Dataset

For this project, you'll be using two datasets:

- [Dataset: SAT Scores](./data/sat.csv)
- [Dataset: ACT Scores](./data/act.csv)

You can see the source for the SAT data [here](https://blog.prepscholar.com/average-sat-scores-by-state-most-recent), and the source for the ACT data [here](https://blog.prepscholar.com/act-scores-by-state-averages-highs-and-lows)
These data, give average SAT and ACT scores by state, as well as participation rates, for the graduating class of 2017.

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

- Read in your datasets.
- Try out a few NumPy commands to describe your data.
- Write pseudocode before you write actual code. Thinking through the logic of something helps.  
- Read the docs for whatever technologies you use. Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow, but not always, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success!
- Document **everything**.

### Presentation Structure

- 5-7 minutes long.
- Use Powerpoint or some other visual aid.
- Consider the audience. Assume you are presenting to non-technical executives with the College Board (the organization that administers the SATs).
- Start with the guiding question/big idea.
- Talk about your procedure/methodology (high level, no need to show code unless you found a useful method to share).
- Talk about your findings/answers to prompts (include visuals).
- Conclude - highlight any next steps, further questions, what you would do with more time, additional data that would be useful.

Be sure to rehearse and time your presentation before class.

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

Your instructors will score you using the scale below:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals!
