### Overview

This week in class we went over some basic statistics, learned some Python programming concepts, and also learned how to navigate files, packages, and libraries using the command line. Great start! At this point you should be champing at the bit to _do some Data Science_. If so, good - because it's time for Project 1!

For our first project, we're going to take a look at SAT and ACT scores around the United States. Suppose that the College Board - the organization that administers the SAT - seeks to improve the participation rate of its exams. Your presentation should be geared toward **non-technical** executives with the College Board and you will use, at minimum, the provided data to make recommendations about how the College Board might work to increase the participation rates of these exams.

**Goal**: A Jupyter notebook that describes your data with visualizations & statistical analysis.

**Goal**: A 5-7 minute presentation targeted to your hypothetical client that highlights your findings.

**Goal**: Your Jupyter notebook hosted on your personal static site.

### Requirements

Your work must _at a minimum_:

- Describe the data
- Perform methods of exploratory data analysis, including:
  - Use Matplotlib to create visualizations
  - Use NumPy to explore distributions of individual variables and relationships among pairs of variables
- Display your cleaned Jupyter notebook on a personal static website.

#### ***Bonus:***
 - Recreate all of your MatPlotLib graphs in Seaborn!
 - Use Tableau Public to create visualizations!
 - Create a blog post of at least 500 words (and 1-2 graphics!) describing your data, analysis, and approach. Link to it in your Jupyter notebook.
 - Using existing features, engineer new features

While there are very specific asks in the starter code, these are only requirements, not restrictions. Feel free to do more EDA, feature engineering, visualization, etc. than what is requested.

### Necessary Deliverables / Submission

- Materials must be submitted in a clearly commented Jupyter notebook.
- Notebook must be submitted via pushing to the remote repo.
- Presentation must be submitted via Slack (for a PowerPoint file) or shared via a Google Form.
- Your notebook and presentation slides must be additionally hosted on your personal static site.
- **Materials must be submitted by 9:00 AM on Friday, October 6th.**

### Starter code

For this project we will be using a Jupyter notebook. This notebook will use matplotlib for plotting and visualizing our data. This type of visualization is handy for prototyping and quick data analysis. We will discuss more advanced data visualizations for communicating your work.

Open the [starter code instructions](./code/) in a Jupyter notebook.

### Dataset

For this project, you'll be using two datasets:

- [Dataset: SAT Scores](./data/sat.csv)
- [Dataset: ACT Scores](./data/act.csv)

You can see the source for the SAT data [here](https://blog.prepscholar.com/average-sat-scores-by-state-most-recent), and the source for the ACT data [here](https://blog.prepscholar.com/act-scores-by-state-averages-highs-and-lows).

These data give average SAT and ACT scores by state, as well as participation rates, for the graduating class of 2017.

### Presentation Structure

- 5-7 minutes long.
- Use PowerPoint or some other visual aid.
- Consider the audience. Assume you are presenting to non-technical executives with the College Board (the organization that administers the SATs).
- Start with the guiding question/big idea.
- Talk about your procedure/methodology (high level, no need to show code unless you found a useful method to share).
- Talk about your findings/answers to prompts (include visuals).
- Conclude - highlight any next steps, further questions, what you would do with more time, additional data that would be useful.

Be sure to rehearse and time your presentation before class.

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

- Read in your datasets.
- Try out a few NumPy commands to describe your data.
- Write pseudocode before you write actual code. Thinking through the logic of something helps.  
- Read the documentation for whatever technologies you use. Learning how to read documentation is crucial to your success - and oftentimes the documentation will include a tutorial you can follow!
- Document **everything**.

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

Your instructors will score you using the scale below:

|      **Score**     |     **Expectations**     |
|:-------------:|:--------------:|
|  **0** | Fail. At least one project criterion was not met or some flagrant issue occurred. |
| **1** | Pass. Project criteria were minimally met. Non-trivial changes would be needed to make this work-ready.    |
| **2** | Pass. Project criteria were met. This presentation needs, at most, trivial changes to be work-ready. |
| **3** | Pass. This presentation is excellent, exceeds requirements in a substantial way, and is a model for the rest of the class. |

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals!
